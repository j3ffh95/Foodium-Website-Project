## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ESNext, font awesome, lightbox2, theMealDB

This project was created to show my understanding of using APIS. I got to use an APi by getting information from it and display it aswell.

#### Future Updates

* Make a user input more than one ingredient
* Update the contact section
* Use a second API to add other things like drinks
* Add super simple stylesheet that adds proper styling


## Lessons Learned:

Learned more about the npm packages like lightbox2, this package is awesome its easy to use and also helps you make a gallery modal so easy to build. 
Can't wait to use other packages and discover more great stuff like this.
